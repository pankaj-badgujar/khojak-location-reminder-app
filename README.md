## CS5520 Mobile Application Development Project 

<br/>Group Members: Pankaj Badgujar, Devansh Gandhi

App is published on google play store, we have also uploaded APK file on google drive. (see point 4)

### Permissions:
Also, our application requires *Location permission* of your android device as it is a location based reminder and tracker app.

### Logging in:
Although user creation is provided, in order to ease the process we have kept it only limited to entering an username for registration (no password). 

Further to ease the grading, we have created 4 mock users: **Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dan** for you to try and test out the application. Can use any of these usernames when asked at the login screen.
